# Standard bans. Used with /sban <player> <default ban name>
# Set timeout to "permanent" for a permanent ban.
# Non-permanent timeouts can use any time/date units from milliseconds to years.
#   ms = milliseconds
#   s = seconds
#   m = minutes
#   h = hours
#   d = days
#   W = weeks
#   M = months
#   Y = years
# The units can be combined, for example "6d 4h 51m" = 6 days, 4 hours and 51 minutes.
# Overflow of units is also allowed. For example, "194m" = 194 minutes = 3 hours and 14 minutes.
